## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
-   Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
    -   Any input field is empty
    -   The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Notes

Instead of showing an error message on form submition, I chose to use a regex and React controlled inputs, to try and guide the user into what the form expects as input.

This, in my opinion, allows for a smoother UX as it leaves very little for the user to think about. Just type the card info, and don't worry about the format.
